## About the Project
The website link to this project can be found <a href="https://nahdaaj.github.io/online-cv/">here</a>. The aim of this project was to practice all of my CSS3 and HTML5 knowledge, and even attempt to learn new features. This is my first real attempt at front-end development, and I hope to integrate JavaScript in the future.

This project is intended to be an improved version of my original HTML resume project. The original website link can be found <a href="https://nahdaaj.github.io/HTML_Resume/">here</a> and the GitHub repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/NahdaaJ/HTML_Resume">here</a>. 

## Built With
This project was built using the following technologies and languages:
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Future Features
In the future, I am considering creating the following features:
- **Night Mode** - I want to allow the user to be able to toggle night and day mode, making it more readable.
- **Mobile Friendly** - I would like my website to be readable on a mobile phone screen.
- **Screen Size** -  I want the website to fit correctly with any screen size, and able to change layout if the screen is minimised.
- **Interate JavaScript** - I would like to add more functionality to the project by integrating the JavaScript DOM.
