                    <p>This is a Library Management System project. This project mimics how a library system would run,

                        user and staff login with different functionalities. The users can loan, return and search for

                        Staff
                        can create, delete and edit users, renew books and edit the book inventory table. The project is
                        linked
                        to a
                        library manager relational database, that contains three tables that are responsible for book

                    <p>This is a math game that I used to practice my OOP skills! It was created as a console app on
                        Microsoft Visual Studio. The user can choose to play an addition, subtraction, multiplication or
                        division game, and can set the game difficulty. Past games can also be viewed. This application
                        was created for my nephew, so he could practice his mathematics in a fun way!</p>

                    <p>The C# Password Manager program was built as a console app on Microsoft Visual Studio. The user
                        initially has to enter a master username and password to access the service. Three wrong tries
                        results in the program recording the time and date as a 'breach'. If the user successfully logs
                        in, they can choose to add, delete, or view passwords. They can also view all breach attempts.
