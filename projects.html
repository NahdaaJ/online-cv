                <p>This project allows users to search and save recipes. The program uses the Edamam API to generate and
                    search
                    for recipes depending on calorie limit, dietary requirements, and/or main ingredient. When prompted,
                    the
                    program can create a meal plan using user input. When the user is satisfied with the meal plan, the
                    program
                    provides a shopping list.</p>

                <p>A project that aims to immitate the famous Top Trumps game using external, third-party API's. During
                    the
                    game,
                    the user is presented a card from which they have to choose a stat. The stat is compared against the
                    same
                    stat on the CPU's card, and the higher stat wins the round and gains a point. At the end, the player
                    with
                    the highest number of points wins. Previous game history with timestamps and details can be viewed.

                <p>This is a Library Management System project. This project mimics how a library system would run,

                    Staff
                    can create, delete and edit users, renew books and edit the book inventory table. The project is
                    linked
                    to a
                    library manager relational database, that contains three tables that are responsible for book
